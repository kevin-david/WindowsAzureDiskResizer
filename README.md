## Growing disks

The following steps should be taken for growing a disk:
* Shutdown the VM
* Delete the VM -or- detach the disk if it’s not the OS disk
* In the Microsoft Azure portal, delete the disk (retain the data!) do that the lease Microsoft Azure has on it is removed
* Run WindowsAzureDiskResizer with the correct parameters
* In the Microsoft Azure portal, recreate the disk based on the existing blob
* Recreate the VM  -or- reattach the disk if it’s not the OS disk
* Start the VM
* Use diskpart / disk management to resize the partition
